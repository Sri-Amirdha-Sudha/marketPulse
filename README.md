- **Top-Selling Books**: Ranked by ratings and reviews.
- **Average Rating per Author**: Highlights top authors.
- **Total Reviews**: Shows customer engagement.
- **Preferred Book Length**: Identifies average duration of popular books.
- **Price Analysis**: Examines preferred price ranges.

- **Data Processing**: Cleaned data in Power BI.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI.
